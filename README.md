# GeneticAlgorithmPython
This is the python implementation of Genetic Algorithm.
The code is take from Yarpiz Team's Course "Genetic Algorithms in Python and Matlab" by Dr.Mostapha Kalami Heris.

The purpose of my upload to github is so that students can easily use the real coded genetic algorithm by just implementing the cost function without having to code spend time coding the enitre structure.

I have added some useful comments in the app.py file so that it is easy to set the parameters.
